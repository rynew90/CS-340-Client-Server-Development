# CS-340-Client-Server-Development

*How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

```In order to create a program that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable I implemented an object oriented approach in developing the script to work with the Animal Shelter database. The code containing the CRUD functions were each written separate so they did not affect one another. This allows the code to be much more easily understood by anyone who intends to use it or understand what its purpose is. This script could be used to view, add, modify, or remove any entries in any database that it may be applied to.```
    
*How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

```When approaching a problem, I try to find the easiest solution to the problem at hand and work to find a solution that is both creative and simple enough to be implemented in other programs that may have similar issues. This will allow the solution to be general enough that it will need little to no modification to work in another program. This strategy is one that I have used for the majority of my CS education so far, and I intend to use it so long as it continues to work in solving the problems that I am faced with solving.```

*What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

```Computer Scientists create new technology or modify existing technology to improve the lives of people across the world. I believe my work in this project would help a company access a large amount of data easily and efficiently, while allowing for a strong sense of user authorization if needed for this particular application.```
